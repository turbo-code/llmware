- [RAG using CPU-based (No-GPU required) Hugging Face Models with LLMWare on your laptop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjgqOZ2v5oU)

## üå± Getting Started

### 1. Install llmware:

```bash
pip install llmware
```
or 
```bash
python3 -m pip install llmware
```
See [Working with llmware](#%EF%B8%8F-working-with-the-llmware-github-repository) for other options to get up and running.

### 2. MongoDB and Milvus

MongoDB and Milvus are optional and used to provide production-grade database and vector embedding capabilities. The fastest way to get started is to use the provided Docker Compose file which takes care of running them both:
```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llmware-ai/llmware/main/docker-compose.yaml
```
and then run the containers:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Not ready to install MongoDB or Milvus?  Check out what you can do without them in our [examples section](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/blob/main/examples/README.md#using-llmware-without-mongodb-or-an-embedding-database).

See [Running MongoDB and Milvus](#%EF%B8%8F-alternate-options-for-running-mongodb-and-milvus) for other options to get up and running with these optional dependencies.

### 3. üî• Start coding - Quick Start For RAG üî• 
```python
# This example demonstrates Retrieval Augmented Retrieval (RAG):
import os
from llmware.library import Library
from llmware.retrieval import Query
from llmware.prompts import Prompt
from llmware.setup import Setup

# Update this value with your own API Key, either by setting the env var or editing it directly here:
openai_api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]

# A self-contained end-to-end example of RAG
def end_to_end_rag():
    
    # Create a library called "Agreements", and load it with llmware sample files
    print (f"\n > Creating library 'Agreements'...")
    library = Library().create_new_library("Agreements")
    sample_files_path = Setup().load_sample_files()
    library.add_files(os.path.join(sample_files_path,"Agreements"))

    # Create vector embeddings for the library using the "industry-bert-contracts model and store them in Milvus
    print (f"\n > Generating vector embeddings using embedding model: 'industry-bert-contracts'...")
    library.install_new_embedding(embedding_model_name="industry-bert-contracts", vector_db="milvus")

    # Perform a semantic search against our library.  This will gather evidence to be used in the LLM prompt
    print (f"\n > Performing a semantic query...")
    os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false" # Avoid a HuggingFace tokenizer warning
    query_results = Query(library).semantic_query("Termination", result_count=20)

    # Create a new prompter using the GPT-4 and add the query_results captured above
    prompt_text = "Summarize the termination provisions"
    print (f"\n > Prompting LLM with '{prompt_text}'")
    prompter = Prompt().load_model("gpt-4", api_key=openai_api_key)
    sources = prompter.add_source_query_results(query_results)

    # Prompt the LLM with the sources and a query string
    responses = prompter.prompt_with_source(prompt_text, prompt_name="summarize_with_bullets")
    for response in responses:
        print ("\n > LLM response\n" + response["llm_response"])
    
    # Finally, generate a CSV report that can be shared
    print (f"\n > Generating CSV report...")
    report_data = prompter.send_to_human_for_review()
    print ("File: " + report_data["report_fp"] + "\n")

end_to_end_rag()
```

### 4. Accessing LLMs and setting-up API keys & secrets
To get started with a proprietary model, you need to provide your own API Keys.  If you don't yet have one, more information can be found at: [AI21](https://docs.ai21.com/docs/quickstart), [Ai Bloks](https://www.aibloks.com/contact-us), [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api),  [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/start/quickstarts/api-quickstart), [OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/collections/3675940-getting-started-with-openai-api).

API keys and secrets for models, aws, and pinecone can be set-up for use in environment variables or managed however you prefer. 

You can also access the `llmware` public model repository which includes out-of-the-box custom trained sentence transformer embedding models fine-tuned for the following industries: Insurance, Contracts, Asset Management, SEC. These domain specific models along with llmware's generative BLING model series ("Best Little Instruction-following No-GPU-required") are available at [llmware on Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/llmware). Explore using the model repository and the `llmware` Huggingface integration in [llmware examples](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware/blob/main/examples/README.md).

## üì£  Release notes and Change Log

**Supported OS's:**  
- MacOS
- Linux
- (Windows is a roadmap item)

**Supported Vector Databases:**
- Milvus
- FAISS
- Pinecone
- MongoDB Atlas Vector Search

**Prereqs:**  
- All Platforms: [python v3.9 - 3.10](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)
- Mac: [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) is used to install the native dependencies
- Linux: 
  1. The pip package attempts to install the native dependencies. If it is run without root permission or a package manager other than Apt is used, you will need to manually install the following native packages: ```apt install -y libxml2 libpng-dev libmongoc-dev libzip4 tesseract-ocr poppler-utils```   *Note:  libmongoc-dev <= v1.24.4 is required.
  2. The llmware parsers optimize for speed by using large stack frames. If you receive a "Segmentation Fault" during a parsing operation, update the system's 'stack size' resource limit: ```ulimit -s 32768000```.  If running llmware in a container then the ulimit needs to be set by the host with a command like the following: ```docker run --ulimit stack=32768000:32768000 ...```
  

**Optional:**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 

**Known issues:**
- A segmentation fault can occur when parsing if the native package for mongo-c-driver is 1.25 or above.  To address this issue, install llmware v0.1.6 and above or downgrade mongo-c-driver to v1.24.4.
